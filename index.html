    <h2>Toby</h2>

      <p>
        Toby was brought home in September 2018. He was a surprise to me! My family went out one
        day and said they were at the petstore getting a bird. My family are not the type of people
        to like birds so I thought it was suspicious. However, I let it slide because maybe my family 
        wanted to try out something new! They come home and call me to come down the stairs. I see a cat/dog
        cage and thought: "Huh, was an interesting cage to bring home a bird in and why are they so silent?". 
        Then, once they open the cage I see a small cat! From that point on, Toby became apart of the family.

    <h2>Stewie</h2>
    <div id="journey-stewie">
      <img src="journey-stewie.png" alt="journey-stewie">
      <p>
        During October 2023, I got Kijiji and starting browsing and looking at the cats on there for fun.
        I come across many cute cats but ONE stuck out to me the most. Stewie. His original listing said he was $800
        which was over my budget so my sister told me not to get him. Then over the next few days, I couldn't stop looking
        back at his listing. Then one day, I see his price got lowered to $650 and contacted the seller, IMMEDIATELY. Then,
        I showed my family friend in Waterloo the cat and we find out that the seller is located in Moorefield, ON. When the
        listing said it was located in Kitchener. This slightly discouraged me since the trip would be 40 minutes drive from Waterloo.
        However, my family friend said she was willing to drive me. We go to Moorefield the next day and I meet Stewie and get him
        with no hesitation.
